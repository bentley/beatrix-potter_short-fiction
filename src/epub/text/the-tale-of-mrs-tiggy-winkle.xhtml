			</header>
			<p>Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl⁠—only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!</p>
			<p>One day little Lucie came into the farmyard crying⁠—oh, she did cry so! “I’ve lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have <em>you</em> seen them, Tabby Kitten?”</p>
			<p>The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen⁠—</p>
			<p>“Sally Henny-penny, have <em>you</em> found three pocket-handkins?”</p>
			<p>But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking⁠—</p>
			<p>“I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!”</p>
			<p>And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.</p>
			<p>Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.</p>
			<p>Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town⁠—a hill that goes up⁠—up⁠—into the clouds as though it had no top!</p>
			<p>And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.</p>
			<p>Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep pathway⁠—up and up⁠—until Little-town was right away down below⁠—she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!</p>
			<p>Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hillside.</p>
			<p>Someone had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water⁠—but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an eggcup! And where the sand upon the path was wet⁠—there were footmarks of a <em>very</em> small person.</p>
			<p>Lucie ran on, and on.</p>
			<p>The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes⁠—props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins⁠—but no pocket-handkerchiefs!</p>
			<p>But there was something else⁠—a door! straight into the hill; and inside it someone was singing⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“Lily-white and clean, oh!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With little frills between, oh!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smooth and hot⁠—red rusty spot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never here be seen, oh!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Lucie, knocked⁠—once⁠—twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out “Who’s that?”</p>
			<p>Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?⁠—a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams⁠—just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie’s head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.</p>
			<p>There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.</p>
			<p>Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap⁠—where Lucie had yellow curls⁠—that little person had <strong>prickles</strong>!</p>
			<p>“Who are you?” said Lucie. “Have you seen my pocket-handkins?”</p>
			<p>The little person made a bob-curtsey⁠—“Oh, yes, if you please’m; my name is <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please’m, I’m an excellent clear-starcher!” And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.</p>
			<p>“What’s that thing?” said Lucie⁠—“that’s not my pocket-handkin?”</p>
			<p>“Oh no, if you please’m; that’s a little scarlet waistcoat belonging to Cock Robin!”</p>
			<p>And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.</p>
			<p>Then she took something else off a clotheshorse⁠—</p>
			<p>“That isn’t my pinny?” said Lucie.</p>
			<p>“Oh no, if you please’m; that’s a damask tablecloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it’s stained with currant wine! It’s very bad to wash!” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle’s nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.</p>
			<p>“There’s one of my pocket-handkins!” cried Lucie⁠—“and there’s my pinny!”</p>
			<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.</p>
			<p>“Oh that <em>is</em> lovely!” said Lucie.</p>
			<p>“And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, that’s a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny⁠—look how she’s worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She’ll very soon go barefoot!” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle.</p>
			<p>“Why, there’s another handkersniff⁠—but it isn’t mine; it’s red?”</p>
			<p>“Oh no, if you please’m; that one belongs to old <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rabbit; and it <em>did</em> so smell of onions! I’ve had to wash it separately, I can’t get out the smell.”</p>
			<p>“There’s another one of mine,” said Lucie.</p>
			<p>“What are those funny little white things?”</p>
			<p>“That’s a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself.”</p>
			<p>“There’s my last pocket-handkin!” said Lucie.</p>
			<p>“And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?”</p>
			<p>“They’re little dicky shirtfronts belonging to Tom Titmouse⁠—most terrible particular!” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle. “Now I’ve finished my ironing; I’m going to air some clothes.”</p>
			<p>“What are these dear soft fluffy things?” said Lucie.</p>
			<p>“Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.”</p>
			<p>“Will their jackets take off?” asked Lucie.</p>
			<p>“Oh yes, if you please’m; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here’s one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They’re <em>always</em> marked at washing!” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle.</p>
			<p>And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes⁠—small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waistcoat; and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing⁠—and at last the basket was empty!</p>
			<p>“Then <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle made tea⁠—a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle’s hand, holding the teacup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soapsuds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were <em>hairpins</em> sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn’t like to sit too near her.</p>
			<p>When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie’s pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.</p>
			<p>And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the doorsill.</p>
			<p>Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!</p>
			<p>All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!</p>
			<p>And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle.</p>
			<p>So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie’s one little bundle.</p>
			<p>Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say “Good night,” and to thank the washerwoman⁠—But what a <em>very</em> odd thing! <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!</p>
			<p>She was running running running up the hill⁠—and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown⁠—and her petticoat?</p>
			<p>And <em>how</em> small she had grown⁠—and <em>how</em> brown⁠—and covered with <strong>prickles</strong>!</p>
			<p>Why! <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a <strong>Hedgehog</strong>.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile⁠—but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?</p>
			<p>And besides⁠—<em>I</em> have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells⁠—and besides <em>I</em> am very well acquainted with dear <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle!)</p>
