			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-218">
				<img alt="A rabbit sits on the grass, looking angry and purposeful. Its ears are standing up, and it has wrinkled its nose." src="../images/illustration-218.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-219">
				<img alt="A rabbit runs from right to left. Its little white tail is sticking up, along with its whiskers." src="../images/illustration-219.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>This is a fierce bad Rabbit; look at his savage whiskers, and his claws and his turned-up tail.</p>
			<p>This is a nice gentle Rabbit. His mother has given him a carrot.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-220">
				<img alt="A good rabbit sits up on a small wooden bench, in a field in front of some trees. It’s munching on the side of a carrot. Behind it, the running bad rabbit approaches." src="../images/illustration-220.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-221">
				<img alt="The bad rabbit stands on the bench next to the good rabbit and reaches out for the carrot. The good rabbit looks worried." src="../images/illustration-221.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>The bad Rabbit would like some carrot.</p>
			<p>He doesn’t say “Please.” He takes it!</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-222">
				<img alt="The bad rabbit pushes over the good rabbit, grabs the carrot, and quickly puts it in its mouth." src="../images/illustration-222.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-223">
				<img alt="The bad rabbit runs after the good rabbit trying to attack it. In the background on the bench the carrot lies forgotten." src="../images/illustration-223.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>And he scratches the good Rabbit very badly.</p>
			<p>The good Rabbit creeps away, and hides in a hole. It feels sad.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-224">
				<img alt="The good rabbit crouches inside a hole with its ears pulled back. In the distance the outline of the bad rabbit can be seen standing on the bench." src="../images/illustration-224.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>This is a man with a gun.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-225">
				<img alt="A man with a ginger beard is walking with a shotgun under his arm. He’s wearing knee-high boots, brown trousers, a green jacket, a green hat, and has a bag slung over his shoulder." src="../images/illustration-225.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-226">
				<img alt="The man has seen the bad rabbit sitting on the bench in the distance. He readies his gun." src="../images/illustration-226.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>He sees something sitting on a bench. He thinks it is a very funny bird!</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-227">
				<img alt="The bad rabbit sits calmly on the bench, nibbling on the carrot it’s holding in its paw. Behind, next to a tree, creeps the man with his gun." src="../images/illustration-227.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>He comes creeping up behind the trees.</p>
			<p>And then he shoots⁠—<strong>Bang!</strong></p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-228">
				<img alt="The man raises the gun to his shoulder and points it to the right of the picture." src="../images/illustration-228.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-229">
				<img alt="A cloud of whirling lines, through which can be seen a carrot, a pair of rabbit ears, and a fluffy white tail." src="../images/illustration-229.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>This is what happens⁠—</p>
			<p>But this is all he finds on the bench, when he rushes up with his gun.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-230">
				<img alt="The man runs up to the bench, on which is lying a white fluffy tail, a carrot, and a small pile of whiskers." src="../images/illustration-230.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>The good Rabbit peeps out of its hole,</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-231">
				<img alt="The good rabbit looks worriedly at the man with the gun running up to the bench." src="../images/illustration-231.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-232">
				<img alt="Bad rabbit sprints across the grass, missing its whiskers and tail." src="../images/illustration-232.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>And it sees the bad Rabbit tearing past⁠—without any tail or whiskers!</p>
