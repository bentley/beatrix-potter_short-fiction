			<p>Once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll’s-house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney.</p>
			<p>It belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals.</p>
			<p>Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-110">
				<img alt="Lucinda is talking to Jane, who is standing in the corner next to a clock and a vase of red flowers. On the floor next to them is a large cardboard box labelled “Provisions 6d.”" src="../images/illustration-110.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<img alt="The box of provisions has been opened. On plates in front of it sits a range of food." src="../images/illustration-111.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>There were two red lobsters and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges.</p>
			<p>They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful.</p>
			<p>One morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll’s perambulator. There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet. Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.</p>
			<p>Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again.</p>
			<p>Tom Thumb was a mouse.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-112">
				<img alt="Tom Thumb is a brown mouse with big black eyes. He is peeping out of a hole in the wall next to the head of another mouse. In front of him is the corner of a red and blue rug." src="../images/illustration-112.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

			</figure>
			<p>A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.</p>
			<p>The doll’s-house stood at the other side of the fireplace. Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug. They pushed the front door⁠—it was not fast.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-114">

			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-115">
				<img alt="Both the mice gaze in wonder at the brightly lit front room of the doll’s-house." src="../images/illustration-115.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room. Then they squeaked with joy!</p>
			<p>Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table! There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs⁠—all <em>so</em> convenient!</p>
			<p>Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham. It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red.</p>
			<p>The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.</p>
			<p>“It is not boiled enough; it is hard. You have a try, Hunca Munca.”</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-116">
				<img alt="The mice are sitting at a table covered in beautiful food. Tom Thumb has a fork in his left paw and a knife in his right, and is attempting to carve the ham." src="../images/illustration-116.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<img alt="Hunca Munca stares at Tom Thumb as he attempts to carve the ham." src="../images/illustration-117.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Hunca Munca stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife.</p>
			<p>“It’s as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger’s,” said Hunca Munca.</p>
			<p>The ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.</p>
			<p>“Let it alone,” said Tom Thumb; “give me some fish, Hunca Munca!”</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-118">
				<img alt="Tom Thumb crouches on the chair as the ham and plate crashes to the floor. In the background Hunca Munca is holding up the plate of fish." src="../images/illustration-118.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-119">
				<img alt="Tom Thumb smashes the plate and ham to pieces with a tiny shovel. His chair has toppled over in his rage. Hunca Munca is still holding the plate of fish." src="../images/illustration-119.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Hunca Munca tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish.</p>
			<p>Then Tom Thumb lost his temper. He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel⁠—bang, bang, smash, smash!</p>
			<p>The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!</p>
			<p>Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca. They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears and the oranges.</p>
			<p>As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-120">
				<img alt="Tom Thumb attempts to force the plate of fish into the doll’s-house fireplace. Hunca Munca is helping from on top of the mantelpiece." src="../images/illustration-120.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-121">
				<img alt="Tom Thumb peeks out of the top of the doll’s-house chimney, while Hunca Munca looks out through one of the bedroom windows." src="../images/illustration-121.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Tom Thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top⁠—there was no soot.</p>
			<p>While Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment. She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labelled⁠—Rice⁠—Coffee⁠—Sago⁠—but when she turned them upside down, there was nothing inside except red and blue beads.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-122">
				<img alt="Hunca Munca is sitting on the countertop in the kitchen, and emptying a jar marked “Rice.”" src="../images/illustration-122.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-123">
				<img alt="Hunca Munca is sitting on a bed covered with a blue and white striped blanket and a large pile of feathers. In the background, Tom Thumb is pushing a pink dress through the window." src="../images/illustration-123.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could⁠—especially Tom Thumb! He took Jane’s clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top floor window.</p>
			<p>But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind. After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda’s bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed.</p>
			<p>With Tom Thumb’s assistance she carried the bolster downstairs, and across the hearthrug. It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse-hole; but they managed it somehow.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-124">
				<img alt="The two mice carefully carry the mouse-sized bolster down the stairs of the doll’s-house. Next to the bottom of the stairs stands a chest of drawers with the drawers half open and a saucepan on top." src="../images/illustration-124.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-125">
				<img alt="The mice are attempting to squeeze through the hole in the wall many things they’ve taken from the doll’s-house, including a lamp, a red chest, and a mouse-sized birdcage with a green parrot in it." src="../images/illustration-125.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Then Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a bookcase, a birdcage, and several small odds and ends. The bookcase and the birdcage refused to go into the mouse-hole.</p>
			<p>Hunca Munca left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-126">
				<img alt="The mice push a wicker-work rocking cradle with a pink blanket over the rug towards the hole in the wall." src="../images/illustration-126.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-127">
				<img alt="The mice run across the rug. One is carrying a chair, and the other a brush and some puffy blue cloth. Jane and Lucinda have arrived in the doorway in a wicker-work pram with a pink coverlet." src="../images/illustration-127.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Hunca Munca was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing. The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.</p>
			<p>What a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda!</p>
			<p>Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled⁠—but neither of them made any remark.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-128">
				<img alt="The two dolls survey the damage to the house. Lucinda has her arms up, but Jane is completely straight as she leans." src="../images/illustration-128.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-129">
				<img alt="Hunca Munca, wearing a blue dress, sits in a rocking chair holding a baby mouse. Next to her is the wicker-work cradle with a pink coverlet." src="../images/illustration-129.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>The bookcase and the birdcage were rescued from under the coal-box⁠—but Hunca Munca has got the cradle, and some of Lucinda’s clothes.</p>
			<p>She also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-130">
				<img alt="Hunca Munca, wearing a pink dress with a white apron, inspects a frying pan. Next to her are other pans, kettles, and the cradle with two baby mice in it." src="../images/illustration-130.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-131">
				<img alt="A doll dressed as a policeman is guarding the door of the doll’s-house from Hunca Munca. She’s holding a baby mouse, and two more mice are peering in through the front window at Jane. Through one of the upstairs windows we can see another mouse." src="../images/illustration-131.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>The little girl that the doll’s-house belonged to, said⁠—“I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!”</p>
			<p>But the nurse said⁠—“I will set a mouse-trap!”</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-132">
				<img alt="Tom Thumb is standing in front of Hunca Munca and baby mouse, and explaining about the big mouse trap next to him to his other three children." src="../images/illustration-132.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>So that is the story of the two Bad Mice⁠—but they were not so very very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke.</p>
			<p>He found a crooked sixpence under the hearthrug; and upon Christmas Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-133">
				<img alt="Jane and Lucinda are tucked up in bed. By the light of a small lantern, the mice are pushing a small coin into one of the red and white stockings that are hanging from the foot of the bed." src="../images/illustration-133.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-134">
				<img alt="Hunca Munca is carrying a dustpan and brush, and carefully pushing open the green door of the doll’s-house." src="../images/illustration-134.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>And very early every morning⁠—before anybody is awake⁠—Hunca Munca comes with her dustpan and her broom to sweep the Dollies’ house!</p>
